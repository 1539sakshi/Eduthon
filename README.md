## PROBLEM STATEMENT
While coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, many countries have decided to close schools as part of a social distancing policy, not just affecting the academics but now they are a problem for the emerging minds.

Even though e-learning has become a new normal for us, faculties and students are still facing loads of difficulties. Many teachers are using the video platforms for the first time and are unaware of the correct usage which leads to raucuss in the classes!

There exists no examination platform yet!

Not only the faculties are stressed because of the circumstances but the students too are quite uncertain and frustrated regarding the future.

Lack of resources for assignment submission, practical analysis, experimental demonstration and short conceptual questions are the cons of online education.
