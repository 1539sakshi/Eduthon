## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- While coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, many countries have decided to close schools as part of a social distancing policy, not just affecting the academics but now they are a problem for the emerging minds.

- Even though e-learning has become a new normal for us, faculties and students are still facing loads of difficulties. Many teachers are using the video platforms for the first time and are unaware of the correct usage which leads to raucuss in the classes!

- There exists no examination platform yet!

- Not only the faculties are stressed because of the circumstances but the students too are quite uncertain and frustrated regarding the future.

- Lack of resources for assignment submission, practical analysis, experimental demonstration and short conceptual questions are the cons of online education.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION 
- CR roles in the classes to help teachers with the technicalities.

- Secure Examination platform by using window sharing and video streaming at the same time, guided by an invigilator.

- Personal counselling which allows students to converse anonymously with the counsellors, who would help them decrease their anxiety and stress.

- Learning made visible by the use of proper portal for students and faculties where students can attend quizzes made by their teachers, receive assignments and make submissions, decrease their search time by acquiring proper notes from their teachers.

- Practical analysis would increase their abilities, Smart revision would ease the so called examfear for them.  

- Understanding concepts better with the help of Augmented Reality models and diagrams.
